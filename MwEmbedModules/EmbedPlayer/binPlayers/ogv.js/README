ogvjs.js contains the OgvJsPlayer wrapper class and the low-level codec payload.
These may be split into separate files in future.
Highly recommended to enable gzip compression on the web server for .js files,
as it cuts the transfer size down to about 1/4.

dynamicaudio.swf is a thin linear PCM audio output shim used by ogv.js when the
W3C Web Audio API is not available, as on IE 10/11.
